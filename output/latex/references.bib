	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Quality of life ({QOL}) in people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ({ALS}) and their caregivers may depend on disease progression, premorbid characteristics (e.g., personality or demographics), or idiosyncratic effects (e.g., life events unrelated to the disease). Furthermore, effects may differ for patients and caregivers; physical decline may impact the caregiver more than the patient.
{PURPOSE}: The present study examined {QOL} in {ALS} patients and their caregivers over the course of the illness.
{METHODS}: Longitudinal data from {ALS} patients (N = 55) and caregivers (N = 53) yielded estimates of the sources of and changes over time in total {QOL} as well as individual domains (psychological existential, physical, and social) as measured by the {McGill} Quality of Life Questionnaire.
{RESULTS}: For both patients and caregivers, about half of {QOL} variance emerged from stable individual differences. Passage of time did not affect {QOL} in patients, but total {QOL} and particularly {QOL} related to physical symptoms declined over time in caregivers. Gender was mostly unrelated to {QOL} in patients and caregivers, but younger caregivers had lower {QOL} across a number of domains.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Low {QOL} among {ALS} patients is likely due to pre-existing individual differences, whereas both individual differences such as demographics (e.g., age) and disease progression are likely to affect {QOL} among caregivers.},

This study aimed to determine the care burden and related factors among family caregivers of Turkish {ALS} patients. Methods: This descriptive study was conducted with 108 {ALS} patients and their informal caregivers through face-to-face interviews at home. The data were collected using the {ALS} Functional Rating Scale, Zarit Burden Interview, European Quality of Life-Five Dimensions Questionnaire, Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Results: The mean age of the caregivers was 48.1 ± 13.4 years; the vast majority were female, and they were either spouses or children of the patients. While 49.1\% reported moderate or severe burden, the quality of life was moderate (mean 70.4 ± 22.8). The caregiver burden was related to sex and the functional state of the patient, as well as caregiver factors such as the relation to the patient, sex, health status, time spent for care, and living in the same house with a limited environment. Walking ability, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy, tracheostomy, and communication problems were not associated with the burden. Furthermore, burden was associated with the caregiver's quality of life, social support, anxiety, and depression. Conclusions: The present study draws attention to the fact that the care burden in family caregivers of {ALS} patients is high and their quality of life is impaired. Our findings reveal that not only {ALS} patients but also caregivers need to be supported with an organized and planned system.},

              Background 
              Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ({ALS}) is characterized by a rapid disease course, with disease severity being associated with declining health-related quality of life ({HRQoL}) in persons living with {ALS} ({pALS}). The main objective of this study was to assess the impact of disease progression on {HRQoL} across King’s, Milano-Torino Staging ({MiToS}), and physician-judgement clinical staging. Additionally, we evaluated the impact of the disease on the {HRQoL} of care partners ({cALS}). 
             
             
              Methods 
              Data were sourced from the Adelphi {ALS} Disease Specific Programme ({DSP})™, a cross-sectional survey of neurologists, {pALS} and {cALS} presenting in a real-world clinical setting between July 2020 and March 2021 in Europe and the United States. 
             
             
              Results 
               
                Neurologists ( 
                n 
                 = 142) provided data for 880 {pALS}. There were significant negative correlations between all three clinical staging systems and {EuroQol} (European Quality of Life) Five Dimension Five Level Scale ({EQ}-5D-5L) utility scores and visual analogue scale ({VAS}) ratings. Although not all differences were significant, 5-item Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Assessment Questionnaire ({ALSAQ}-5) scores showed a stepwise increase in {HRQoL} impairment at each stage of the disease regardless of the staging system. At later stages, high levels of fatigue and substantial activity impairment were reported. As {pALS} disease states progressed, {cALS} also experienced a decline in {HRQoL} and increased burden. 
               
             
             
              Conclusions 
              Across outcomes, {pALS} and {cALS} generally reported worse outcomes at later stages of the disease, highlighting an unmet need in this population for strategies to maximise {QoL} despite disease progression. Recognition and treatment of symptoms such as pain and fatigue may lead to improved outcomes for {pALS} and {cALS}.},

	abstract = {Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ({ALS}) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease that causes progressive autonomy loss and need for care. This does not only affect patients themselves, but also the patients' informal caregivers ({CGs}) in their health, personal and professional lives. The big efforts of this multi-center study were not only to evaluate the caregivers' burden and to identify its predictors, but it also should provide a specific understanding of the needs of {ALS} patients' {CGs} and fill the gap of knowledge on their personal and work lives. Using standardized questionnaires, primary data from patients and their main informal {CGs} (n = 249) were collected. Patients' functional status and disease severity were evaluated using the Barthel Index, the revised Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale ({ALSFRS}-R) and the King's Stages for {ALS}. The caregivers' burden was recorded by the Zarit Burden Interview ({ZBI}). Comorbid anxiety and depression of caregivers were assessed by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Additionally, the {EuroQol} Five Dimension Five Level Scale evaluated their health-related quality of life. The caregivers' burden was high (mean {ZBI} = 26/88, 0 = no burden, ≥24 = highly burdened) and correlated with patients' functional status (rp = -0.555, p {\textless} 0.001, n = 242). It was influenced by the {CGs}' own mental health issues due to caregiving (+11.36, 95\% {CI} [6.84; 15.87], p {\textless} 0.001), patients' wheelchair dependency (+9.30, 95\% {CI} [5.94; 12.66], p {\textless} 0.001) and was interrelated with the {CGs}' depression (rp = 0.627, p {\textless} 0.001, n = 234), anxiety (rp = 0.550, p {\textless} 0.001, n = 234), and poorer physical condition (rp = -0.362, p {\textless} 0.001, n = 237). Moreover, female {CGs} showed symptoms of anxiety more often, which also correlated with the patients' impairment in daily routine (rs = -0.280, p {\textless} 0.001, n = 169). As increasing disease severity, along with decreasing autonomy, was the main predictor of caregiver burden and showed to create relevant (negative) implications on {CGs}' lives, patient care and supportive therapies should address this issue. Moreover, in order to preserve the mental and physical health of the {CGs}, new concepts of care have to focus on both, on not only patients but also their {CGs} and gender-associated specific issues. As caregiving in {ALS} also significantly influences the socioeconomic status by restrictions in {CGs}' work lives and income, and the main reported needs being lack of psychological support and a high bureaucracy, the situation of {CGs} needs more attention. Apart from their own multi-disciplinary medical and psychological care, more support in care and patient management issues is required.},

              Aims and objectives 
              This study set out to describe caregiver experience, health‐related quality of life and life satisfaction among informal caregivers to patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and to explore factors associated with caregivers’ health‐related quality of life and life satisfaction. 
             
             
              Background 
              Knowledge about factors related to caregivers’ health‐related quality of life and life satisfaction is important for identification of those at risk for ill health and for development of support and care. 
             
             
              Design 
              A cross‐sectional study. 
             
             
              Methods 
               
                Forty‐nine informal caregivers and 49 patients were included. Standardised and study‐specific questionnaires were used for data collection on caregiver experience (Caregiver Reaction Assessment), health‐related quality of life ({EuroQol} Visual Analogue Scale, 
                {SF} 
                ‐36), life satisfaction (Life Satisfaction Checklist) and caregiver‐ and patient‐related factors. Associations were explored by regression analyses. 
               
             
             
              Results 
              Both positive and negative caregiver experience were reported, and health‐related quality of life and life satisfaction were below national reference values. Positive experience was associated with better and negative with worse mental health‐related quality of life. Factors related to informal caregivers (sex, age, living conditions) and patients (anxiety and/or depression) were related to caregivers’ health‐related quality and life satisfaction. 
             
             
              Conclusion 
              The results indicate the need to consider the individual caregiver's experience when planning services, care and support. It is important to adopt person‐centred care, not only for patients but also for their informal caregivers, as factors related to both parties were associated with the informal caregivers’ health‐related quality of life and life satisfaction. 
             
             
              Relevance to clinical practice 
              Our study suggests that promoting positive experience and providing services and support to reduce negative aspects of caregiving might be important strategies for healthcare personnel to improve informal caregivers’ health.},

              Background 
              Motor neuron disease ({MND}) is a rapidly progressive, fatal neurodegenerative disease that predominantly affects motor neurons from the motor cortex to the spinal cord and causes progressive wasting and weakening of bulbar, limb, abdominal and thoracic muscles. Prognosis is poor and median survival is 2–3 years following symptom onset. Psychological distress is relatively common in people living with {MND}. However, formal psychotherapy is not routinely part of standard care within {MND} Care Centres/clinics in the {UK}, and clear evidence-based guidance on improving the psychological health of people living with {MND} is lacking. Previous research suggests that Acceptance and Commitment Therapy ({ACT}) may be particularly suitable for people living with {MND} and may help improve their psychological health. 
             
             
              Aims 
              To assess the clinical and cost-effectiveness of {ACT} modified for {MND} plus usual multidisciplinary care ({UC}) in comparison to {UC} alone for improving psychological health in people living with {MND}. 
             
             
              Methods 
              The {COMMEND} trial is a multi-centre, assessor-blind, parallel, two-arm {RCT} with a 10-month internal pilot phase. 188 individuals aged ≥ 18 years with a diagnosis of definite, laboratory-supported probable, clinically probable, or possible familial or sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and additionally the progressive muscular atrophy and primary lateral sclerosis variants, will be recruited from approximately 14 {UK}-based {MND} Care Centres/clinics and via self-referral. Participants will be randomly allocated to receive up to eight 1:1 sessions of {ACT} plus {UC} or {UC} alone by an online randomisation system. Participants will complete outcome measures at baseline and at 6- and 9-months post-randomisation. The primary outcome will be quality of life at six months. Secondary outcomes will include depression, anxiety, psychological flexibility, health-related quality of life, adverse events, {ALS} functioning, survival at nine months, satisfaction with therapy, resource use and quality-adjusted life years. Primary analyses will be by intention to treat and data will be analysed using multi-level modelling. 
             
             
              Discussion 
              This trial will provide definitive evidence on the clinical and cost-effectiveness of {ACT} plus {UC} in comparison to {UC} alone for improving psychological health in people living with {MND}.

Thirty-three dyads of incident patients with {ALS} and their primary caregivers (n = 33) completed a series of measures to determine cognitive and behavioural profiles, (patients) and carer burden (carers) to investigate the psychological impact of {ALS}, and the impact of behavioural change since the onset of {ALS}. Caregivers were divided into high- and low-burden groups using previously established norms. High burden in carers was associated with significantly higher apathy (p = 0.009), disinhibition (p = 0.005), and executive dysfunction (p = 0.015) in patients. Regression analyses for burden confirmed significant predictors such as change in apathy (r = 0.390, F = 5.19, p = 0.03), disinhibition (r = 0.530, F = 11.32, p = 0.002), and executive dysfunction (r = 0.372, F = 4.66, p = 0.039), with total behaviour change contributing to 31 \% of caregiver burden (r = 0.563, F = 4.17, p = 0.015). Total distress as measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale was also a significant predictor of caregiver burden, contributing to 38.5 \% of variance (r = 0.621, F = 18.79, p {\textless} 0.000). Caregiver burden did not affect survival (p = 0.496). Caregiver burden in {ALS} is modulated by patient's cognitive and behavioural status, but does not significantly impact patient survival.},

{AIM}: To evaluate the evidence on patient and caregiver factors associated with caregiver burden in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis informal caregivers.
{DESIGN}: A systematic review.
{DATA} {SOURCES}: Four electronic databases were searched up to 2017. Studies that investigated quantitative relations between patient or caregiver factors and caregiver burden were included. The overall quality of evidence for factors was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach.
{RESULTS}: A total of 25 articles were included. High quality of evidence was found for the relation between caregiver burden and the factor "behavioral impairments." Moderate quality of evidence was found for the relations between caregiver burden and the factors "feelings of depression" of the caregiver and "physical functioning" of the patient. The remaining rated caregiver factors-"feelings of anxiety," "distress," "social support," "family functioning," and "age"-and patient factors-"bulbar function," "motor function," "respiratory function," "disease duration," "disinhibition," "executive functioning," "cognitive functioning," "feelings of depression," and "age"-showed low to very low quality of evidence for their association with caregiver burden.
{CONCLUSION}: Higher caregiver burden is associated with greater behavioral and physical impairment of the patient and with more depressive feelings of the caregiver. This knowledge enables the identification of caregivers at risk for caregiver burden and guides the development of interventions to diminish caregiver burden.},

The purpose of this analysis was to describe an informal caregiver cohort (n = 81), their subjective assessment of burden and difficulties experienced as a result of providing care to people with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis ({ALS}).
{METHODS}: Using mixed methods of data collection and analysis, we undertook a comprehensive assessment of burden and difficulties associated with informal caregiving in {ALS}. As part of a semi-structured interview a series of standardised measures were used to assess quality of life, psychological distress and subjective burden, and in an open-ended question caregivers were asked to identify difficult aspects of their caregiving experience.
{RESULTS}: The quantitative data show that psychological distress, hours of care provided and lower quality of life, were significant predictors of caregiver burden. From the qualitative data, the caregiving difficulties were thematised around managing the practicalities of the {ALS} condition, the emotional and psychosocial impact; limitation and restriction, and impact on relationships.
{CONCLUSIONS}: The collection and analysis of quantitative and qualitative data better explores the complexity of caregiver burden in {ALS}. Understanding the components of burden and the difficulties experienced as a result of caring for someone with {ALS} allows for better supporting the caregiver, and assessing the impact of burden on the care recipient.},

{BACKGROUND}: Burdens of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and their caregivers in Chinese population are largely unknown.
{DESIGN}: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 81 pairs of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients and their caregivers.
{METHODS}: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients' self-perceived burden and caregivers' burden were assessed by the Self-Perceived Burden Scale and Zarit-Burden Interview, respectively. Quality of life of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients was measured using the World Health Organization Quality of Life-Bref. The amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Functional Rating Scale-Revised questionnaire was used to estimate patients' physical function.
{RESULTS}: Both patients and caregivers reported a mild to moderate burden. The World Health Organization quality of life-Bref scores were decreased in respondents with lower amyotrophic lateral sclerosis Functional Rating Scale-Revised, higher Self-Perceived Burden Scale and higher Zarit-Burden Interview scores. Self-Perceived Burden Scale scores were associated with patients' knowledge of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, respiratory function and female sex. Zarit-Burden Interview scores were associated with caregivers' age, patients' motor function and out-of-pocket payment.
{CONCLUSION}: With increase in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients' self-perceived burden and caregivers' burden, quality of life of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients decreased. Female patients, who had known more about the disease, and those with severe respiratory dysfunction were subject to higher self-perceived burden. Older caregivers and caregivers of patients with severe motor dysfunction and more out-of-pocket payment experienced more care burdens.
{RELEVANCE} {TO} {CLINICAL} {PRACTICE}: Our study suggests that paying more attention to female amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients might benefit patients in China or other South-East Asian countries under the Confucian concept of ethics. There is an urgent demand to expand medical insurance coverage to cover amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in China and other developing countries. Long and adequate supports are needed for relieving caregiver's burden. To improve the quality of life of patients, relieving the patients' {SBP} and caregivers' burden is likely to be not only required, but also essential.},

              Background 
              Given the degenerative nature of the condition, people living with motor neuron disease ({MND}) experience high levels of psychological distress. The purpose of this research was to investigate the cost‐effectiveness of acceptance and commitment therapy ({ACT}), adapted for the specific needs of this population, for improving quality of life. 
             
             
              Methods 
               
                A trial‐based cost–utility analysis over a 9‐month period was conducted comparing {ACT} plus usual care ( 
                n 
                 = 97) versus usual care alone ( 
                n 
                 = 94) from the perspective of the National Health Service. In the primary analysis, quality‐adjusted life years ({QALYs}) were computed using health utilities generated from the {EQ}‐5D‐5L questionnaire. Sensitivity analyses and subgroup analyses were also carried out. 
               
             
             
              Results 
              Difference in costs was statistically significant between the two arms, driven mainly by the intervention costs. Effects measured by {EQ}‐5D‐5L were not statistically significantly different between the two arms. The incremental cost‐effectiveness was above the £20,000 to £30,000 per {QALY} gained threshold used in the {UK}. However, the difference in effects was statistically significant when measured by the {McGill} Quality of Life‐Revised ({MQOL}‐R) questionnaire. The intervention was cost‐effective in a subgroup experiencing medium deterioration in motor neuron symptoms. 
             
             
              Conclusions 
              Despite the intervention being cost‐ineffective in the primary analysis, the significant difference in the effects measured by {MQOL}‐R, the low costs of the intervention, the results in the subgroup analysis, and the fact that {ACT} was shown to improve the quality of life for people living with {MND}, suggest that {ACT} could be incorporated into {MND} clinical services.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Behavioral changes in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ({ALS}) mirror those found in frontotemporal dementia ({FTD}). Considering the high rate of neuropsychiatric symptoms found in {ALS} patients, this paper examines whether caregiver burden is associated with behavioral changes over and above the physical disability of patients with {ALS}, and if the presence of caregivers' depression, anxiety and stress also impacts on caregiver burden.
{METHODS}: 140 caregivers of patients with {ALS} participated in a postal survey investigating patients' neuropsychiatric symptoms (Cambridge Behaviour Inventory Revised {CBI}-R), motor function (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale Revised - {ALSFRS}-R), caregiver burden (Zarit Burden Interview), and caregiver mood (Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale- {DASS}21). Seventy four percent of them were caregivers of patients with limb onset and 25.7\% were caregivers of patients with bulbar onset.
{RESULTS}: Moderate to severe behavioral changes were reported in 10-40\% of patients with {ALS}. The levels of depression, anxiety and stress in the caregivers reached 20\%. Burden was high in 48\% of the caregivers. The strongest predictor of high caregiver burden was {ALS} patients' abnormal behavior rather than physical disability, with an odds ratio of 1.4, followed by caregivers' stress.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Our study has identified that behavioral changes (e.g. disinhibition, impulsivity) and caregiver stress have greater impact on caregiver burden than level and pattern of physical disability.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The world's population is ageing, resulting in rising care demands and healthcare costs, which in turn lead to a shift from formal to informal care. However, not only is the number of potential informal carers fast decreasing, but also informal caregivers are experiencing a higher caregiver burden. This literature review aims to synthesize the literature on the common determinants of caregiver burden in Western countries, to help ensure future continuation of informal care in the home context, and to improve or sustain the quality of life of caregivers and patients alike.
{METHOD}: A systematic review of peer-reviewed articles included in {PubMed}, Scopus, and/or {PsychInfo} was conducted.
{RESULTS}: Seventeen articles were included. The most important predictors were the duration of caregiving and the patient's dependency level, in terms of both physical and mental dependency stemming from decreased cognitive capacity or behavioural problems. Some specific illnesses and role conflicts or captivity also increased caregiver burden, whereas social support lowered it. Being a female caregiver or having an adult-child relationship led to a higher burden.
{CONCLUSIONS}: The most important predictors of caregiver burden are the duration of caregiving and the patient's dependency level. In addition, the patient's behavioural problems and cognitive capacity determine dependency level, and thus care burden. Interventions to relieve burden need to be adapted to the illness trajectory of specific diseases and corresponding needs for social support for both the recipient and the caregiver. Changing role expectations, leading to men being more involved, could reduce the disproportionately high burden for women.},

The five factors assessed were financial status, social support, employment status, religious denomination, and patient disease severity. A prospective, cross-sectional study of 50 caregivers was performed using the Beck Depression Inventory ({BDI}), Zarit-Burden Interview ({ZBI}), a demographic survey, and patient {ALS} functional rating scale, revised ({ALSFRS}-R) scores. Younger age, female gender, higher financial burden, type of religious denomination, and longer daily hours spent both with the patient and caregiving were associated with {BDI} scores, indicating they are significant risk factors for depression symptoms. Both younger age and the daily hours spent caregiving, as well as being employed and having less social support, were associated with {ZBI} scores and higher burden. Adequate social support was the only protective factor in caregivers' lives, having an association with lower burden levels. There was no statistically significant association between a caregiver's {BDI} or {ZBI} score and patient {ALSFRS}-R scores. In conclusion, we identified factors associated with depression symptoms and increased burden in {ALS} caregivers. Interventions should be designed to target the modifiable factors in order to prevent depression symptoms and minimize burden in caregivers at risk.},
